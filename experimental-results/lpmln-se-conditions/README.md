# SE-Conditions format
## discovered SE-conditions
+ SE-condition ::= [non-empty independent sets [:singleton independent sets]]
+ non-empty independent sets ::= list of independent set names 
+ singleton independent sets ::= list of independent set names

## simplified SE-conditions
+ SE-condition ::= [non-empty independent sets] : [empty independent sets] : [singleton independent sets]
+ non-empty independent sets ::= list of independent set names
+ empty independent sets ::= list of independent set names  
+ singleton independent sets ::= list of independent set names

# empty independent sets
+ I-3, I-6, and I-7 independent sets of all SE-conditions are empty;
+ I-5 independent sets of 0-2-1, 1-2-0, and 1-1-1 SE-conditions are empty.
